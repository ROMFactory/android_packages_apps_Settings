 * On an incoming pairing of a newly paired device, setPreferred of the profiles needs to be called to enable incoming/outgoing connections
 * Fixed a race condition during pairing with carkits wherein connect was issued even before ACTION.uuid changed was received.
 * On bluetooth disable, delete all devices that are not bonded
 * Fix  to update the checkbox attribute values after connect() is called; This is to make sure for profiles like HID where re-connection can happen only from the device side, the UI is updated to be in sync with the right priority of the corresponding profiles
 * Revert "Changes done to update UI with appropriate checkbox state, when AVRC Connect is initiated from the headset. Earlier, the checkbox state was not being updated when the connection state changed for media audio, when connected from headset"
 * Headset connection status is displayed incorrectly, as the boolean mIsProfileReady is not initalized properly. Make sure mIsProfileReady is initialized always when onServiceConnected is received
 * Fixed null pointer exception when BT is enabled from settings screen with previously bonded devices
 * Changes done to update UI with appropriate checkbox state, when AVRC Connect is initiated from the headset. Earlier, the checkbox state was not being updated when the connection state changed for media audio, when connected from headset
 * Clear the Available (unbonded devices) from the CachedDevices List during BT disable.
 * Auto connect  hf/a2dp when any one of them gets connected and timeout happens
 * Fixed settings crash fix when profile is connected, Bluetooth turned off/of and phone is rebooted
 * Auto connect hf/a2dp
 * Fixed issue with Settings app crashing after turning on/off and clicking unpair
 * Added null pointer check
 * add discoverability timoeut when set by 3rd party app
 * Enable exported:true flag to ensure that intents from other applications can be received
 * Fix discoverability timeout issues. (a) implement timeout logic (b) persist 'never timeout' after reboot (c) code cleanup

 * Fix issues with updating list when applications get installed while ManageApps is paused or stopped. When ManageApps gets started, the list of installed apps is retrieved from PackageManager and compared against the old list to figure out newly installed apps(since the app has been stopped) and also to weedout stale entries of packages which might have been deleted. Since the application objects themselves might have changed the list is usually refreshed with new objects. Deleted applications are taken care of right away by just removing from the List adapter. For newly added apps however, the size and label/resource info has to be loaded before being inserted in to the list since the list is already sorted. So just remove these entries from the list for now and let ADD_PKG message handle adding the new elements. Make AppInfo a nested class so that it doesn't hold a reference to its enclosing class and  we have too many such entries one for each package.

 * Fix bug 2088099 where the TTS example doesn't play in the Settings app when the UI is in Japanese. Rewrite of the initialization of the default language in the TTS Settings. The previous implementation had the following issues: - the "Listen to an example" didn't use the default settings - the string used for the example didn't match the selected language  (this was in order to not imply that TTS is doing translation, but   that proved confusing to users). The language initialization is now implemented in initDefaultLang() and ensures that the default locale is one supported in the array of available locales. The speech rate is also initialized from the settings or the default rate (if no value was stored in the settings).
